2023 Empoleon Concept Inspired by the similarity between the KSU AUV logo and a certain Pokémon, an idea emerged. Overview This year, the KSU AUV team wanted to create something new. Instead of using a previous AUV, the team is beginning from scratch for an entirely new concept. The Empoleon concept is inspired by the Pokémon, Empoleon. This is due to the KSU AUV logo bearing a striking resemblance to the Pokémon. Thus, the development stages are composed of the evolutionary stages of Empoleon; that being Piplup, Prinplup, and Empoleon. Early Development: Piplup Stage Design The design is rendered through SolidWorks in order to get a clear idea of what the AUV will look like. Our mechanical team is working on solidifying dimensions and any other discrete variables. Once a render is completed, the mechanical team may begin working on a 3d printed render.

Figure 1: General View Figure 2: Side View After careful consideration and small adjustments, a refined render is created to better represent the Piplup stage. This version, shown in Figure 3, is rendered clearer so that the mechanical team has an easier time working with it. Figure 3: Refined Render Modeling Quickly after the initial renders, the mechanical team began to model some of the aluminum parts that will house the AUV. The parts are designed to be rigid while avoiding heavy weights. Some of the rendered parts are shown below as Figure 4 through 6.
